        <p>San Francisco is often called <strong><em>"Everybody’s Favorite City,"</em></strong> a title earned by its scenic beauty, cultural attractions, 
        diverse communities, and world-class cuisine. Measuring <strong>49 square miles,</strong> this very walk-able city is dotted with landmarks like
         the <strong>Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, Alcatraz and the <em>largest</em> Chinatown in the United States</strong>. A stroll of the City’s streets 
         can lead from Union Square to North Beach to Fisherman’s Wharf, with intriguing neighborhoods to explore at <strong><em>every</em></strong> turn. 
         Views of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay are often laced with fog, creating a romantic mood in this most European of 
         American cities.</p>
                 
        <h2>Places to visit and things to do</h2>

        	<p>Between San Francisco Bay and Marin County is the world famous <strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong>. The bridge has been declared one 
        	 of the modern wonders of the world. It was opened in 1937 and at that time it was the <em>longest</em> suspension bridge ever 
        	 created.</p>
        	<p>Made from steel and with a total length of <em>1.7 miles</em> it is the most photographed bridge anywhere is the world. There are
        	 six lanes of traffic on the bridge carrying <strong>millions</strong> of passengers <strong>every year</strong>. Before the bridge was built people used to 
        	 have to get a ferry between the two places, the ferry company was called Golden State Ferry Company and at one point it 
        	 was the <em>largest</em> ferry company on the planet.</p>
        	
        	<li class="place-item"><strong>Stroll through Golden Gate Park</strong></li>
        	<p></p>
        	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Golden_Gate_Park_07.JPG" alt="Golden Gate Park" width="400">
        	<p>Each year <strong>13 million visitors</strong> visit Golden Gate Park and explore one of San Francisco’s most amazing places. This 
        	picturesque space spans <em>1,017</em> acres and has many places to explore and relax. You can discover the lakes, picnic areas, 
        	monuments, playgrounds and gardens.</p>
        	<p>Throughout the calendar there are a plethora of events and activities that take place in the park. You can even hold 
        	your own wedding or special event in the beautiful gardens and take photographs with the <em>stunning</em> scenery as a back drop.</p>
        	
        	<li class="place-item"><strong>Visit Alcatraz Island</strong></li>
        	<p></p>
        	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Alcatraz_Island_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg" alt="Alcatraz Island" width="400">
        	<p>1.5 miles off the shore of San Francisco is <strong>Alcatraz Island</strong>, This <em>tiny</em> island was developed as a military fortification,
        	 a military prison as well as a federal prison. This was between 1933 and 1963.</p>
        	<p>The thinking behind the federal prison was that the prisoners who caused <em>continual</em> trouble at other prisons would be 
        	locked up here. Many infamous prisoners have stayed here including <strong>Al Capone</strong> and <strong>Robert Franklin Stroud</strong>. The island now is 
        	a tourist attraction and <em>many</em> people flock here each year to explore the depths of the prison.</p>
        	
        	<li class="place-item"><strong>Experience Chinatown like never before</strong></li>
        	<p></p>
        	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/San_Francisco_China_Town_MC.jpg" alt="San Francisco Chinatown" width="400">
        	<p>Most major cities have a Chinatown, but San Francisco has <strong><em>four</em></strong> and the one on Grant Avenue is the biggest Chinatown 
        	outside of Asia as well as being the oldest in North America. The town is <em>so</em> big that is encompasses two hospitals, various
        	parks and <strong>draws more visitors each year than the Golden Gate Bridge.</strong></p>
        	<p>If you are looking for <em>authentic</em> Chinese cuisine in San Francisco there is no point looking <em>anywhere</em> outside of the four 
        	Chinatowns to find real traditional Chinese food. If you are in the city during the Autumn Moon Festival you can visit this 
        	Chinese festival for <strong>free.</strong></p>
        	
        	<li class="place-item"><strong>Ride the San Francisco Cable Car System</strong></li>
        	<p></p>
        	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Cable_Car_No._1_and_Alcatraz_Island.jpg" alt="San Francisco Cable Car" width="200">
        	<p>San Francisco is <em>very</em> proud of their cable car system. It is the <strong><em>last</em></strong> manually operated system in the world today. At 
        	its peak you would find 23 cable car lines in the city, but today we have just three left. <strong>Nearly all of the people</strong> that 
        	ride the cars today are tourists looking to try that something different when in town.</p>
        	<p>The first of the cable cars was opened in in 1873 and due to their popularity and the money that the owners were making 
        	more lines were added. In 1892 the first electric streetcars were made and so the decline of the manual car began.</p>
        	
        	<li class="place-item"><strong>Take a trip down Lombard Street</strong></li>
        	<p></p>
        	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Lombard_Street_2020.jpg" alt="Lombard Street" width="200">
        	<p>Located between Hyde and Leavenworth streets, Lombard Street is famously known as the <strong>"crookedest street in the <em>world</em>"</strong>
        	although it is neither the crookedest street in San Francisco (Vermont Street is) nor the steepest.</p>
        	<p>The <strong>one-block portion</strong> of Lombard Street that contains <strong><em>eight</em></strong> hairpin turns was created to reduce the hill’s natural steep 
        	slope. The speed limit in this section is a mere <strong><em>5 mph (8 km/h).</em></strong></p>
